# Rafi's Personal Project
## Colour Scheme Generator

### What is it?
Inspired by my passion for graphic design, I will be creating a **colour scheme generator** for my personal project.
Colour schemes are an integral part of any design, whether it is a movie poster or a user interface. There are some key
ideas that must be present in a good colour scheme, such as contrast and value. I want to create a program that, given 
a colour of the user's choice, outputs a variety of colour schemes for the user to consider. The user can then look
through the schemes and if they are captivated by any of them, they can save it to their collection for further viewing.
If not, they can reconsider their starting colour and use the generator until they find a colour scheme that fits their
needs.

### Who will use it?
This program can be used by anyone who is designing something, no matter what level of colour theory they have. It can 
be used by graphic designers, game developers, fashion designers, etc. 

### Why this?
Graphic design has been a hobby of mine for over half a decade now, and colour schemes are crucial in the field.
With this program I will be able to automate the process of coming up with colour schemes. I am very curious to see what
level of complexity I can reach with my current skills in programming, so I am excited to see where this project goes.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to **add** a colour scheme to my collection.
- As a user, I want to be able to **generate** colour schemes for a colour that I have chosen.
- As a user, I want to be able to **select** from different types of colour schemes, such as monochromatic or analogous ones.
- As a user, I want to be able to **remove** a colour scheme from my collection.
